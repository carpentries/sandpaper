## Introduction

One of the innovations of {sandpaper} is the out-of-the-box integration with 
GitHub Actions by supplying several workflows that deploy, validate, and update
the lesson. This vignette will focus on the latter set of workflows: those that
update the lesson in some form. In this vignette, we will outline the components
of the lesson that need updating, demonstrate pull requests and the requirements
to set them up on a non-carpentries account, and demonstrate functions to
manually update these components.

## Components which Need to be Updated

The concept of a {sandpaper} lesson is simple: place a set of markdown or R
markdown files in a folder, run a command, and get a website out of it. It's
not much different than a static site generator. What makes it different is
that, with a {sandpaper} lesson, you are no longer solely responsible for
ensuring that the styling and build tools are kept up-to-date as these have been
stripped from the repository and separated into three stand-alone packages.
There are, however two places in a lesson where build requirements still live
and will need updating from time to time: 

 1. Continuous Integration Workflows (in the `.github/` folder)
 2. Lesson Requirements for Generated Content (in the `renv/` folder)

A lesson created with {sandpaper} relies on deployment workflows that live
inside the `.github/` folder to ensure that it can not only be properly deployed,
but also that pull requests can be tested and validated. Additionally, if you
have a lesson that uses generated content via R Markdown, then you will have a
folder called `renv/` in your repository. This folder will contain a lockfile
at `renv/profiles/lesson-requirements/renv.lock`, which will detail the
packages required to build the lesson, along with their versions and specific
hash of the package contents.

## Pull Request Updates

When you host a lesson on one of The Carpentries' repositories, the automated
workflows will periodically check for updates and issue pull requests _if there
are available updates_. These pull requests are designed to be minimally
invasive and predictable to ensure that your lesson remains up-to-date.

In addition to being run periodically, you can run them at any time by going to
your repository > actions and selecting one of the workflows that starts with
"Maintain". There will be a button that says "Run Workflow" that you can push
and it will start the process of checking for updates.

### Weekly Checks: Update Workflows

On a weekly basis, the workflow located in 
`.github/workflows/update-workflows.yaml` will run and update the workflow files
with the current versions from {sandpaper}. This will then create a pull request
with the title "Update Workflows to Version X.Y.Z" from the [Carpentries 
Apprentice Bot](https://github.com/carpentries-bot). _A pull request is only created
if there are updates to be had, otherwise, it will report that there are no
updates at this time._

Check to make sure that this workflow _only_ contains modified workflows in the
.`github/workflows/` and that no secrets have been accidentally divulged.

### Monthly Checks: Update Lesson Requirements

On a monthly basis, if the lesson has generated content, the workflow in 
`.github/workflows/update-cache.yaml` will run to check for updates to the 
lockfile in `renv/profiles/lesson-requirements/renv.lock`. This pull request
will change only the `renv.lock` file and it will report in the pull request 
itself what packages have changed.

This pull request will be followed closely by a comment that will inform you
what has changed in the generated content based on the new versions. If the 
packages are relatively stable, then not much should change. This is the time
to inspect the generated output for any errors that occurr due to packages 
updating their expectations or dependencies.

### Setting up a Pull Request Bot

Both of these pull requests are provided with the help of [The Carpentries 
Apprentice Bot](https://github.com/carpentries-bot). This bot is available across
The Carpentries github organisations and if you have a lesson hosted on one of
these organisations, then you do not need to worry about this section.

If you are hosting your own lesson and would like to take advantage of these
periodic updates, you do not necessarily need a bot account, but you do need 
access to an account that has the following aspects

1. Access to your lesson repository (as a collaborator or self), and 
2. A Personal Access Token registered as `SANDPAPER_WORKFLOW` in that repository
   with the `public_repo` and `workflow` scopes

#### Creating a PAT

Whether or not you choose to use a bot account or your own account, you will
need to [generate a new Personal Access Token with the repo and workflow 
scope](https://github.com/settings/tokens/new?scopes=public_repo,workflow&description=Sandpaper%20Token).

Once there, add more context in the `Note` field, set an expiration date (default
is 30 days), scroll down to the bottom of the page and select "Generate Token"

Your token will appear in a green box and will start with `ghp_`. Copy the token
by clicking on the clipboard symbol immediately to the right of the token and 
then go to your repository > settings > secrets and select "New Repository Secret"
if you haven't created the `SANDPAPER_WORKFLOW` secret before. Add 
`SANDPAPER_WORKFLOW` in the "Name" field and paste your token in the "Value"
field.

## Manual Updates

If you want to create updates manually without using GitHub Actions, there are
two functions available:

```{r eval = FALSE}
update_github_workflows()  # updates the package workflows
update_cache()      # uses `renv::update()` to check for updates to the package cache
```

Both of these functions will modify files locally so if you do not like them,
you can use `git restore .` to revert them to their original state.
