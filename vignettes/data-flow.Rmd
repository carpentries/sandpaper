## Introduction

This is a vignette that is designed for R package developers who are looking to
understand how the data flows between the lesson source and the final website.
I am assuming that the person reading this has familiarity with
[R packaging](https://r-pkgs.org/) and [R
environments](https://r-pkgs.org/data.html#sec-data-state).

One of the design philosophies of The Workbench is that if a lesson author or
contributor would like to add any sort of metadata or modify a setting in any
given lesson, they can do so by editing the source of the lesson with no need to
modify their workflow.

### A note about the design

The design of this is very much PDD (panic-driven design). I was okay with
wracking up technical debt because I knew that I could go back and refactor once
I got it released. If I had a chance to go back and refactor, I would gladly do
so. The creation of muliple storage objects using function factories was what I
knew at the time. I now know that it might be better to use global environments
instead. The implementation of this was originally done in [pull request
#248](https://github.com/carpentries/sandpaper/pull/248), which was trying to
deduplicate code after the release of version 0.1.0, which was a massive push
after finally getting the new website layout.

The flow of data I lay out here could all live in the same package-level
environment (or even a package-level R6 object) instead of being implemented as
function factories, but that's a refactor for another day and another
maintainer.

### Two Sources of Metadata

Metadata is different from content because, while it is not directly related to
the content, it has extra information that helps the users of the site navigate
the content. For example, each episode page has three piece of metadata
embedded as a YAML list at the top of the source file that defines the title
along with estimated time for teaching and excercises.

```yaml
title: "Introduction"
teaching: 5
exercises: 5
```

In terms of the lesson itself, metadata that is related to the whole lesson is
stored in `config.yaml`. This YAML file is designed to be as flat as possible to
avoid common problems with writing YAML. Metadata here include things like the
title of the Lesson, the source page of the lesson, the time it was created, and
the lesson program it belongs to.

```yaml
title: "An Example Lesson"
carpentry: "incubator"
created: "2023-11-27"
life-cycle: "pre-alpha"
```

It also defines optional parameters such as the order of the episodes and other content that can be used to customise how the lesson is built.

```yaml
episodes:
 - introduction.md
 - first-example.md

handout: true
```

The thing to know about this metdata and these variables is that they all get
passed to {varnish} and are used to control how the lesson website is built
along with the metadata.

### An introduction to `{varnish}`

In order to understand how to pass data from `config.yaml` to {varnish}, it is
important to first understand the paradigm of how {sandpaper} and {varnish} work
together to produce a lesson website. Behind the scenes, we build markdown with
{knitr}, render the raw HTML with Pandoc and then use {pkgdown} to insert the
HTML and metadata into a template (written in [the logicless templating
language, Mustache](https://mustache.github.io/mustache.5.html)) that can be
updated and modified independently of {sandpaper}. This template is called
{varnish}.

In the paradigm of {pkgdown}, the HTML template is split up into different
components that are rendered separately and then combined into a single layout
template. For example, here is the template that defines the layout:

````{r varnish-template-layout, echo = FALSE, results = "asis"}
writeLines("```html")
tplt <- system.file("pkgdown", "templates", "layout.html", package = "varnish")
writeLines(readLines(tplt))
writeLines("```")
````

You can see that it contains `{{{ head }}}`, `{{{ header }}}`, `{{{ navbar }}}`,
`{{{ content }}}` and `{{{ footer }}}`. These are all the results of the other
rendered templates. For example, here's the `head.html` template, which defines
the content that goes in the HTML `<head>` tag (defining titles, metadata,
stylesheets, and JavaScript):

````{r varnish-template-head, echo = FALSE, results = "asis"}
writeLines("```html")
tplt <- system.file("pkgdown", "templates", "head.html", package = "varnish")
writeLines(readLines(tplt))
writeLines("```")
````

The templates used by {varnish} will take metadata from one of two sources:

1. a `_pkgdown.yaml` file that defines global metadata like language (see the
   [pkgdown metadata section](#pkgdown-metadata) for details.
2. a list of values passed to the `pkgdown::render_page()` function. These
   values can be both global and local.

These get inserted into the template via the `pkgdown::render_page()` function
where the contents of the `_pkgdown.yaml` file are inserted into the data list
as `$yaml`.

The challenge for {sandpaper} is this: when we have a list of per-lesson global
variables that need to be allocated when `build_lesson()` is run and per-file
variables that need to be allocated before every call to `build_html()`.

The solution that we've come up with is to store these lists in environments
that are encapsulated by function factories, which are detailed in the next
section.

## Storage Function Factories

There are two types of storage [function
factories](https://adv-r.hadley.nz/function-factories.html) in {sandpaper}:
Lesson Store (`.lesson_store()`) and List Store (`.list_store()`). Both of these
return lists of functions that access their calling environments, which are
created when the package is loaded:

### List Store

The list store acts like a persistent list that has `get()` `set()`, `clear()`,
`copy()` and `update()` methods.

```{r list-store}
snd <- asNamespace("sandpaper")
this_list <- snd$.list_store()
names(this_list)
class(this_list)

# to set a list, use a NULL key
this_list$set(key = NULL, list(
  A = list(first = 1),
  B = list(
    C = list(
      D = letters[1:4],
      E = sqrt(2),
      F = TRUE
    ),
    G = head(sleep)
  )
))

# get the list
this_list$get()

# copy a list so that you can preserve the original list
that_list <- this_list$copy()

# update list elements by adding to them (note: vectors will be replaced)
that_list$update(list(A = list(platform = "MY COMPUTER")))
that_list$get()

# set nested list elements
that_list$set(c("A", "platform"), "YOUR COMPUTER")

# note that modified copies do not modify the originals
that_list$get()[["A"]]
this_list$get()[["A"]]
```

### Lesson Store

This creates the object containing the `pegboard::Lesson` object, that we can
use to extract episode-specific metadata along with the text of the questions.
It is a special object because when a lesson is set with this object, it will
additionally set the _other_ global data.

When {sandpaper} is loaded, the List Store and Lesson Store objects are created
and live in the {sandpaper} namespace as long as the session is active.

```{r lesson-store}
snd <- asNamespace("sandpaper")
some_lesson <- snd$.lesson_store()
names(some_lesson)
```

## Example

All of these metadata are collected and stored in memory before the lesson is
built (triggered during `validate_lesson()`), which are accessible via the
objects defined by the internal `sandpaper:::set_globals()`. Here I will set
up an example lesson that I will use to demonstrate these global variables.
Please note that I will be using internal functions in this demonstration. These
internal functions are not guaranteed to be stable outside of the context of
{sandpaper}. Using the `asNamespace("sandpaper")` function allows me to create
a method for accessing the internal functions:

```{r create-namespace-example, message = FALSE}
library("sandpaper")
snd <- asNamespace("sandpaper")
```

```{r, create-example, message = FALSE}
# create a new lesson
lsn <- create_lesson(tempfile(), name = "An Example Lesson",
  rstudio = TRUE, open = FALSE, rmd = FALSE)
# add a new episode
create_episode_md(title = "First Example", add = TRUE, path = lsn, open = FALSE)
```

Within {sandpaper}, there are environments that contain metadata related to the
whole lesson called `.store`, `.resources`, `instructor_globals`,
`learner_globals`, and `this_metadata`. Before the lesson is validated, these
values are empty:

```{r globals-empty}
snd <- asNamespace("sandpaper")
class(snd$.store)
print(snd$.store$get())
class(snd$this_metadata)
snd$this_metadata$get()
class(snd$.resources)
snd$.resources$get()
class(snd$instructor_globals)
snd$instructor_globals$get()
class(snd$learner_globals)
snd$learner_globals$get()
```

These will contain the following information:

 - `.store` a `pegboard::Lesson` object that contains the XML representation of
   the parsed Markdown source files
 - `this_metadata` the real and computed metadata associated with the lesson
   along with the JSON-LD template for generating the metadata in the footer of
   the lesson.
 - `.resources` a list of the availabe files used to build the lesson in the
   order specified by `config.yaml`
 - `instructor_globals` pre-computed global data that includes the sidebar
   template, the syllabus, the dropdown menus, and information about the
   packages used to build the lesson
 - `learner_globals` same as `instructor_globals`, but specifically for learner
   view

When I run `validate_lesson()` the first time, all the metadata is collected and
parsed from the `config.yaml`, and the individual episodes and cached.

```{r validate}
# first run is always longer than the second
system.time(validate_lesson(lsn))
system.time(validate_lesson(lsn))
```

The `validate_lesson()` call will pull from the cache in `.store` if it exists
and is valid (which means that nothing in git has changed). If it's not valid or
does not exist, then all of the global storage is initialised in this general
cascade:

```{r vl-tree, echo = FALSE, eval = getRversion() >= "4.0"}
funs <- c(
  vl = "validate_lesson()",
  tl = "this_lesson()",
  sv = ".store$valid()",
  ggd = "gert::git_diff()",
  ggs = "gert::git_status()",
  ggl = "gert::git_log()",
  pl = "pegboard::Lesson$new()",
  ss = ".store$set()",
  sg = "set_globals()",
  srl = "set_resource_list()",
  res = ".resources$set()",
  grl = "get_resource_list()",
  im = "initialise_metadata()",
  sl = "set_language()",
  av = "add_varnish_translations()",
  tr = "tr_()",
  ts = "these$translations",
  gc = "get_config()",
  tm = "template_metadata()",
  tms = "this_metadata$set()",
  cs = "create_sidebar()",
  crd = "create_resources_dropdown()",
  lgs = "learner_globals$set()",
  igs = "instructor_globals$set()"
)
labels <- funs
to_lab <- c("ss", "res", "tms", "lgs", "igs", "ts")
labels[to_lab] <- cli::col_cyan(cli::style_bold(labels[to_lab]))
vltree <- data.frame(
  fn = funs,
  calls = I(list(
    vl = funs["tl"],
    tl = list(funs["sv"], funs["pl"], funs["ss"]),
    sv = list(funs["ggd"], funs["ggs"], funs["ggl"]),
    ggd = character(0),
    ggs = character(0),
    ggl = character(0),
    pl = character(0),
    ss = list(funs["sg"]),
    sg = list(funs["im"], funs["sl"], funs["srl"], funs["cs"], funs["crd"], funs["lgs"],
      funs["igs"]),
    srl = list(funs["grl"], funs["res"]),
    res = character(0),
    grl = list(funs["gc"]),
    im = list(funs["gc"], funs["tm"], funs["tms"]),
    sl = list(funs["av"]),
    av = list(funs["tr"]),
    tr = list(funs["ts"]),
    ts = character(0),
    gc = character(0),
    tm = character(0),
    tms = character(0),
    cs = character(0),
    crd = character(0),
    lgs = character(0),
    igs = character(0)
    )
  ),
  labels = labels
)
cli::tree(vltree)
```

Now when we these variables are called, you can see the information stored in
them.

## Lesson Storage

This function stores the `pegboard::Lesson` object and is responsible for
initialising and resetting the variable cache.

```{r store-get}
snd <- asNamespace("sandpaper")
class(snd$.store)
print(snd$.store$get())
```

We can check if the cache needs to be reset by using the `$valid()` function
inside this object, which checks the git log, git status, and git diff as a
global check of the lesson contents. When nothing changes, it returns TRUE:

```{r store-valid}
snd$.store$valid(lsn)
```

However, if we update the lesson contents in some way by setting a config
variable, it will be `FALSE`, indicating that it needs to be reset:

```{r store-invald}
set_config(c(handout = TRUE), path = lsn, write = TRUE, create = TRUE)
snd$.store$valid(lsn)
snd$.store$set(lsn)
snd$.store$valid(lsn)
```

## Metadata

The metadata is used to store the content of `config.yaml` and to provide
computed metadata for a lesson that is included in the footer as a JSON-LD
object, which is useful for indexing. Note that this metadata must be
duplicated for each page to give the correct URL and identifiers.

```{r metadata}
snd <- asNamespace("sandpaper")
snd$this_metadata$get()
```

This metadata is rendered as JSON-LD and passed as a new variable to {varnish}
using the internal `fill_metadata_template()` function:

```{r fill-metadata}
writeLines(snd$fill_metadata_template(snd$this_metadata))
```

## Lesson Resources (files)

The next thing that we store globally are the resources we use to build the
lesson. This allows us to avoid needing to constantly read the file system:

```{r resources-get}
snd <- asNamespace("sandpaper")
snd$.resources$get()
```

## Global and Local Variables

The rest are global and local variables that are recorded in the
`instructor_globals` and `learner_globals`. These are copied for each page and
updated with local data (e.g. the sidebar needs to include headings for the
current page).

```{r globals}
snd <- asNamespace("sandpaper")
snd$instructor_globals$get()
snd$learner_globals$get()
```

### Translations

In the majority of the {varnish} templates are keys that need translations that
are in the format of `{{ translate.ThingInPascalCase }}`:

```{r overview, results="asis", echo = FALSE, comment = ""}
writeLines("```html")
writeLines(readLines(system.file("pkgdown/templates/content-overview.html",
      package = "varnish")))
writeLines("```")
```

These variables are in {sandpaper} and are _expected to exist_. Because they
are expected to exist, theese variables are generated and stored in the internal
environment `these$translations` by the function `establish_translation_vars()`
when the package is loaded. When the lesson is validated, these variables are
translated to the correct language with `set_language()` and placed in the
`instructor_globals` and `learner_globals` storage. These variables are passed
directly to {varnish} templates, which eventually get processed by {whisker}:

```{r whisker}
snd <- asNamespace("sandpaper")
whisker::whisker.render("Edit this page: {{ translate.EditThisPage }}",
  data = snd$instructor_globals$get()
)
```

This is key to building lessons in other languages, regardless of your default
language. The lesson author sets the `lang:` config key to the two-letter
language code that the lesson is written in. This gets passed to the
`set_language()` function, which modifies the translations inside the global
data, but it does not modify the language of the user session:

```{r set-language-es}
snd <- asNamespace("sandpaper")
snd$set_config(c(lang = "es"), path = lsn, create = TRUE, write = TRUE)
snd$this_lesson(lsn)
whisker::whisker.render("Edit this page: {{ translate.EditThisPage }}",
  data = snd$instructor_globals$get()
)
Sys.getenv("LANGUAGE")
```

Switching the language is controlled entirely from within the lesson config:

```{r set-language-en}
snd$set_config(c(lang = "en"), path = lsn, create = TRUE, write = TRUE)
snd$this_lesson(lsn)
whisker::whisker.render("Edit this page: {{ translate.EditThisPage }}",
  data = snd$instructor_globals$get()
)
```

### Translation Variables

```{r child="../man/children/translation-vars.Rmd"}
```

## pkgdown metadata

Another source of metadata is that created for the pkgdown in a file called
`site/_pkgdown.yaml`.

```{r yaml, results="asis", echo = FALSE, comment = ""}
writeLines("```yaml")
writeLines(readLines(fs::path(lsn, "site", "_pkgdown.yaml")))
writeLines("```")
```

This file is what allows {pkgdown} to recognise that a website needs to be
built. These variables are compiled into the `pkg` variable that is passed to
all downstream files from `build_site()`. The important elements we use are

 - `$lang` stores the language variable
 - `$src_path` stores the source path of the lesson (the `site/` directory, or
   the location of the `SANDPAPER_SITE` environment variable).
 - `$dst_path` stores the destination path to the lesson (`site/docs`).
   **NOTE:** this particular path _could_ be changed in `build_site()` so that
   we update the name of the path so that it's less confusing. The docs folder
   was a mechanism for pkgdown to locally deploy the site without having to
   affect the package structure (it was also a mechanism to serve GitHub pages
   in the past).
 - `$meta` a list of items passed on to {varnish}

```{r pkgdown}
snd <- asNamespace("sandpaper")
pkg <- pkgdown::as_pkgdown(snd$path_site(lsn))
pkg[c("lang", "src_path", "dst_path", "meta")]
```

Before being sent to be rendered, it goes through one more transformation, which
is where the variable contexts you find in {varnish} come from. The contexts
that we use are `site` for the root path and title, `yaml` for lesson-wide
content, and `lang` to define the language. Everything else is not used.

```{r data-template}
dat <- pkgdown::data_template(pkg)
writeLines(yaml::as.yaml(dat[c("lang", "site", "yaml")]))
```
