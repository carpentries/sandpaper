\description{
Build a home page for a lesson
}
\details{
The index page of the lesson is a combination of two pages:
\enumerate{
\item index.md (or README if the index does not exist)
\item learners/setup.md
}

This function uses \code{\link[=render_html]{render_html()}} to convert the page into HTML, which gets
passed on to the "syllabus" or "overview" templates in {varnish} (via the
\code{\link[=build_html]{build_html()}} function as the \code{{{{ readme }}}} and \code{{{{ setup }}}} keys.
