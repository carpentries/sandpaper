      <div class="d-none name"><code>deployment.Rmd</code></div>
    </div>

    
    
<p>The broad idea of the deployment strategy is encompassed in three
rules:</p>
<blockquote>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>No knowledge beyond markdown and github is required to create a
lesson website</li>
<li>Any elements of the lesson that need to be rendered will be rendered
via continuous integration</li>
<li>All changes to the final site are purposeful</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>The process for adding an episode to a lesson should take three
steps, total:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>place Markdown or R Markdown files in the <code>episodes/</code>
folder</li>
<li>define the order of the episodes in the <code>config.yaml</code>
file</li>
<li>push to github AND/OR preview the website locally with
<code><a href="../reference/build_lesson.html">sandpaper::build_lesson()</a></code>
</li>
</ol>
<div class="section level2">
<h2 id="why-r-markdown">Why R Markdown?<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#why-r-markdown"></a>
</h2>
<p>We have decided on using the R Markdown format because it is a VERY
powerful tool that allows you to write code and text without having to
copy and paste output/images/tables. It has <a href="https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/language-engines.html" class="external-link">support
for several languages including python, BASH, and SQL</a>. Most
importantly: the code rendering features of it are purely optional; you
can strip away all R-associated content and be left with a markdown
document.</p>
<p>This is a system that has already been used for our R lessons for
several years and works fairly well.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level2">
<h2 id="the-two-step-building-locally">The Two-Step: Building Locally<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#the-two-step-building-locally"></a>
</h2>
<p>To preview the lessons, we build the static files locally, without
any servers. While it is possible to go directly from R Markdown to
HTML, we use a two-step process:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Generate static markdown from the source files with a hash of the
original file in the YAML header</li>
<li>Using external style template, generate website HTML from the built
markdown files</li>
</ol>
<div class="info">
<p>NOTE: we need to make sure that we have a renv environment defined
for the lessons, but I think this will need to happen after things are
released on CRAN to avoid maxing out the github api requests.</p>
</div>
<div class="float">
<img src="img%2Flocal-flow.dot.svg" alt='diagram of three folders. The first folder, "episodes/", labelled as RMarkdown, has an arrow (labelled as hash episodes) pointing to "site/built/", labelled as Markdown. The Markdown folder has an arrow (labelled as "apply template") pointing to "site/docs/", labelled as "HTML". The first folder is labelled in pale yellow, indicating that it is the only one tracked by git.'><div class="figcaption">Thr local two-step model of deployment into
local folders</div>
</div>
<p>Now, the first reaction you may have is, “Why do we need a two step
process when we can generate HTML directly from R Markdown?” The answer
is three-fold.</p>
<p>First, if there is R code in the R Markdown document, it takes time
to execute the code and add it in to the output document. By having an
intermediate markdown document that contains a hash of the original
document, we can make sure that we only build the files that have
changed in content with minimal overhead in a manner that is compatible
with R Markdown’s chunk caching feature.</p>
<p>Second, if any generated element of your page creates invalid HTML,
it usually causes a cascading effect that can be hard to track down if
you are looking at raw HTML output. Having a markdown intermediate
allows us to more easily single out any potential problems. This
particular reason is important in the next section for scheduled
deployments where we avoid problems raised explicitly by checking the
output.</p>
<p>Third, having the rendered markdown documents makes them easy to use
with other HTML or pandoc templates not provided by The Carpentries.</p>
<p>You might also be wondering “why aren’t the rendered markdown and
HTML files being tracked by git?” The answer is that, they will be, just
not on your computer.</p>

integration</div>
</div>
<p>Because some lesson content will be auto-generated from an ecosystem
of software that is constantly evolving, it’s important to make sure a
few things are true:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>The website is always up and available (barring blackouts from
GitHub)</li>
<li>The style of the lessons can be updated on the fly.</li>
<li>The output of the lessons match what the maintainers expect.</li>
<li>Changes in the lesson output is easily auditable via git diff.</li>
</ol>
<p>Because we have two sources of entropy (software environment needed
to build the lesson content and CSS/HTML/JS needed to create the
website), it’s important to separate these steps because if there is a
failure, having them separate allows us to audit the failure and fix the
issue on the appropriate end. Thus, we use the same two-step system we
presented earlier in local rendering, with weekly and monthly
checks:</p>
<div class="float">
<img src="https://imgur.com/l64RiGs.png" alt="Diagrammatic representation of the GitHub deployment cycle"><div class="figcaption">Diagrammatic representation of the GitHub
deployment cycle</div>
</div>
<p>Zooming in on the Pull request workflow we can see that there is only
one point of entry. The box elements represent user interactions, the
ellipses are GitHub workflows. The color indicates permission levels for
the workflows. Lavender workflows only have the ability to check out
code and compare it. Wheat/yellow colored workflows have full
permissions to push to the repository:</p>
<div class="float">
<img src="img%2Fpr-flow.dot.svg" alt="Representation of PR deployment cycle"><div class="figcaption">Representation of PR deployment cycle</div>
</div>
<p>Because we only track the source files of the lesson and not the
output from the maintainer’s computer, we need to rely on Continuous
Integration to rebuild the lesson and deploy it to the cloud. We still
use the two-step process here, but the difference is that we don’t want
to make any extra commits to the main branch, so instead of creating the
commits in two extra directories, we create them in orphan branches
called <code>md-sources</code> and <code>gh-pages</code>. The latter is
familiar to most lesson maintainers, and the former serves as a staging
and evaluation area for changes in generated content.</p>
<div class="float">
<img src="img%2Findependent-components.dot.svg" alt="Dependency relationship between components of the Lesson Template"><div class="figcaption">Dependency relationship between components of
the Lesson Template</div>
</div>
<blockquote>
<p>Takeaway from this diagram: Yes, this is complex, but its modularity
ensures that we can replace components without needing to significantly
modify any of the other components.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The diagram above describes the dependency graph of the lesson
template. Each component in the graph represents either a file (beige
files/folders/documents) or tools (boxes). The edges (lines connecting
the components) are categorized with the following labels:</p>
<dl>
<dt>depends</dt>
<dd>
(e.g. a -&gt; b means component a <em>depends on</em> component b). This
is usually reserved for lesson artifacts such as generated markdown and
HTML. If a component is dependent on another component, that means that
it can not exist without the upstream component. Changes in the upstream
component can happen independently to the downstream component, but
these changes will affect the state of the downstream component.
</dd>
<dt>uses</dt>
<dd>
(e.g. a -&gt; b means component a <em>uses</em> aspects of component b).
In this relationship, each of these components are independent and they
can change independent of one another without necessarily affecting the
state of the other.
</dd>
<dt>contains</dt>
<dd>
(e.g. a -&gt; b means component a <em>contains</em> component b). A
component that contains another component <em>must</em> change when the
contained component changes. For example, any changes to the package
cache lockfile requires a corresponding commit in the source files.
</dd>
<dt>modifies</dt>
<dd>
(e.g. a -&gt; b means component a <em>modifies</em> component b).
Modification occurs when a component is the agent of change for a
downstream component, but changes in the upstream component do not
necessarily correspond to a change in the downstream component. For
example the GitHub Actions component is the only one on this graph that
can modify other components (including itself), but if it were to
undergo a change to update frequency, that would not necessarily affect
the changes that the downstream components see.

</h3>
<p>Each time a commit is pushed to the main branch, the command
<code><a href="../reference/ci_deploy.html">sandpaper::ci_deploy()</a></code> is run in GitHub actions and it will
render any changed source files from <code>main</code> to
<code>md-source</code> and then apply the HTML template, <a href="https://github.com/zkamvar/varnish" class="external-link">{varnish}</a> to the files in
<code>md-source</code> to create the website.</p>
<p>This process assumes that pushes to the main branch will not break
the rendering process as they will either be cosmetic changes or changes
that come from pull requests (which have previously been vetted).
<strong>No extra maintainer interaction required.</strong></p>

<p>Each time a pull request is added, the maintainer should be informed
of what changes in the lesson (if anything), so the process goes like
this:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>A pull request triggers a new branch from <code>md-sources</code>
called <code>md-sources-{pr#}</code>.</li>
<li>The PR is built into <code>md-sources-{pr#}</code>
</li>
<li>The diff between <code>md-sources-{pr#}</code> and
<code>md-sources</code> is added to the PR comments as a link.</li>
<li>Any additional commits to the PR branch will be rebuilt and the
changes amended to the <code>md-sources-{pr#}</code> branch
(effectively, a squash merge)</li>
<li>Once the maintainer approves the changes, the PR gets merged into
master, the site is rebuilt from source, and the pr branch is
removed.</li>
</ol>
<div class="float">
<img src="img%2Fpr-merge.svg" alt='diagram showing four branches, where "my-edit" is merged into "main" and that drives the two-step process of rendering "md-outputs" and then "gh-pages".

</h3>
<p>As I mentioned above, the HTML templates will not live within the
lesson repository. They will live in the <a href="https://github.com/zkamvar/varnish" class="external-link">{varnish}</a> package and
applied to the rendered markdown files. This step will start at the
<code>md-source</code> branch and re-apply a fresh version of the
template to bring in any stylistic changes that have occurred in the
{varnish} repository (e.g. new CSS rules) in the previous week.</p>
<p>This step will test that our HTML template is working correctly. If
an error occurs, we know that we need to fix the HTML template and not
the lesson. <strong>No maintainer interaction required.</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="cron-monthly-keeping-software-current">CRON: monthly (keeping software current)<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#cron-monthly-keeping-software-current"></a>
</h3>
<p>Because the weekly CRON jobs ensure that the HTML template works, we
run the monthly jobs to make sure the software stack continues to work
as expected. This is important for making sure that the generated output
matches the output that the learners would see and that the narrative
additionally matches the output.</p>
<p>This will explicitly test changes in the lesson due to changes in the
software stack and not the HTML template. Because many of the changes
will produce technically valid output, <strong>Manual inspection of the
diffs is required</strong>. There are six steps in this process, one of
which requires a maintainer’s input:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>A new branch is created from <code>main</code> with the format
<code>YYYY-MM</code>.</li>
<li>The {renv} configuration file for <code>YYYY-MM</code> is reset and
a Pull Request is created.</li>
<li>The maintainer follows the regular pull request protocol.</li>
