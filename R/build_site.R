  # 1. read in all of the HTML

  # this page via pkgdown is costly as pkgdown has to do a read -> write -> read
  # -> modify loop in order to generate a single page. Because we are using the
  # same template, modifying only a few variables, it is easier for us to create
  # a pre-processed template where we can have variables that we can replace for
  # use.

  # Once we have the pre-processed templates and HTML content, we can pass these
  # to our aggregator functions:
