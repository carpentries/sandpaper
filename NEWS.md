# sandpaper 0.9.4

* The CLI styling of an important message about {renv} has been fixed to be more
  readable (reported: @zkamvar, #331; fixed: @zkamvar, #332).

# sandpaper 0.9.3

MISC
----

* A test that was failing on the R-universe has been skipped
* documentation has been updated to detail the expected and optional values in
  config.yaml in `set_dropdown()`
* The template for the code of conduct has been updated to reflect our style guide

# sandpaper 0.9.2

CONTINUOUS INTEGRATION
----------------------

* The version of the s3-sync action has been corrected. This only affects lessons
  that deploy to AWS

# sandpaper 0.9.1

MISC
---

* Anchor links are now included in all sections and callouts for easy navigation
  to sections. Thanks to @fiveop and @anenadic for requesting this feature.
  requested in #285 and https://github.com/carpentries/workbench/issues/28; 
  fixed in #325

# sandpaper 0.9.0

MISC
----

* `set_config()` gains the option `create`, which will create new variables if
  they do not exist. 

CONTINUOUS INTEGRATION
----------------------

* A new workflow called `deploy-aws.yaml` has been created to deploy a site to
  AWS when the right secrets from AWS are available. Because this workflow
  does not affect normal use, I am relegating this to a patch release.

# sandpaper 0.8.0

CONTINUOUS INTEGRATION
----------------------

* A new workflow called `pr-preflight.yaml` has been created to perform a quick
  pre-flight check on the pull request to ensure that there is no malicious
  activity on the lesson itself, which may look like modifying both workflow
  and lesson files in the same pull request. For lessons that transition to the
  workbench from styles in official and community-developed lessons, an extra
  check is added that will validate the branch of the incoming PR does not
  contain invalid commits.

* Pull Request workflows have been simplified.

# sandpaper 0.7.1

BUG FIX
-------

* A bug where `fail_on_error` defaulted to `true` has been fixed. This will
  default to `false` if they key is not present in `config.yaml` (#314, @zkamvar).

# sandpaper 0.7.0

NEW FEATURE
-----------

* Placing `fail_on_error: true` in `config.yaml` will set the global chunk
  option `error = FALSE` for R Markdown documents, meaning that if an error
  is produced from a chunk, the build will fail unless that chunk explicitly
  uses the `error = TRUE` option. (requested: #306 by @davidps, implemented:
  #310 by @zkamvar)

# sandpaper 0.6.2

BUG FIX
-------

* The sidebar navigation in mobile and tablet views now includes all the 
  information that was included in the navigation bar for the desktop mode. 
  (reported: https://github.com/carpentries/workbench/issues/16#issuecomment-1165307355 by @Athanasiamo and #306, fixed: #309 by @zkamvar)
* the downit shims have been updated to be resiliant to upstream changes


# sandpaper 0.6.1

MISC
----

* the `config.yaml` template has been updated to default to incubator lessons
  and has more helpful information included about formatting (@tobyhodges, #302)

# sandpaper 0.6.0

NEW FEATURES
------------

* `create_lesson()` gains the `rmd` parameter, which is a logical indicator that
  the lesson should use R Markdown (`TRUE` by default). When this is `FALSE`, a
  markdown lesson is created and no package cache is initialised.
* `create_episode()` gains the `ext` parameter, which allows users to create
  plain markdown episodes if they do not need R Markdown functionality
  (see https://github.com/carpentries/sandpaper/issues/296).

BUG FIX
-------

* `create_episode()` will now slugify titles so that they only contain lowercase
  ASCII letters, numbers and UTF-8 characters with words separated by single
  hyphens (see https://github.com/carpentries/sandpaper/issues/294).

MISC
----

* The internal `check_episode()` function has been removed as it was over-
  engineered with marginal value.



# sandpaper 0.5.8

CONTINUOUS INTEGRATION
----------------------

* Running the main workflow from GitHub's actions tab now uses a checkbox to
  indicate if the markdown file cache should be cleared.
* The README file for the workflows no longer contains a link to an image that
  does not exist.

# sandpaper 0.5.7

CONTINUOUS INTEGRATION
----------------------

* Workflows that update lesson elements will now report a more obvious summary
  of next steps to take with an invalid token (see https://github.com/carpentries/actions/pull/45)

# sandpaper 0.5.6

CONTINUOUS INTEGRATION
----------------------

* Pull requests will now report on elements of the lesson that do not pass
  checks.

# sandpaper 0.5.5

MISC
----

* New YAML items can now be added at-will and will be available to varnish in
  a `{{#yaml}}` context. 
* internal function `set_dropdown()` will preserve the yaml items that are not
  explicitly coded in the config menu. 

# sandpaper 0.5.4

BUG FIX
-------

* `build_episode_md()` argument `workenv` now defaults to `globalenv()` to avoid
  S3 dispatch issues that can occur in `new.env()` (see https://github.com/carpentries/sandpaper/issues/288)

# sandpaper 0.5.3

BUG FIX
-------

* Episodes with ampersands in their titles no longer break the aggregate page
  building.

# sandpaper 0.5.2

TEMPORARY BUG FIX
-----------------

* {downlit} shim has been updated to no longer fail when parsing BASH globs.
  (see https://github.com/r-lib/downlit/pull/138)


# sandpaper 0.5.1

NEW FEATURES
------------

* The sidebar now enumerates episodes so it is easier for instructors and
  learners to indicate episode by number instead of by name (suggested by
  @fiveop in #276). (@zkamvar, #277)

NEW SUGGESTS
------------

* {mockr} is now a suggested package (aka soft-dependency) to facilitate testing
  functions that do not need an entire lesson set up to test their functionality

CONTINUOUS INTEGRATION
----------------------

 * `setup-r` and `setup-pandoc` actions have been pinned to version 2
 * `setup-r` action now uses the default R installation on GitHub's runner,
   which decreases build times by ~ 1 minute.
 * All R actions will use the RStudio Package Manager, which should avoid overly
   lengthy build times. 
 * explicit permissions have been set for the deploy workflow (@zkamvar, #279)

# sandpaper 0.5.0

NEW FEATURES
------------

 * `images.html` is built with internal function `build_images()`, collecting
   all images and displaying alt text for non-screen reader users (while
   marking those paragraphs as `aria-hidden` so that screen reader users do not
   have it read twice).
 * `instructor-notes.html` is now built with the internal function
   `build_instructor_notes()` and now collects instructor notes from the
   episodes in a section called `aggregate-instructor-notes`.

MISC
----

 * The internal `build_agg_page()` has a new argument, `append`, which takes an
   XPath expression of what node should have children appended. Defaults to 
   `"self::node()"`. An example of alternate usage is in 
   `build_instructor_notes()`, which uses 
   `section[@id='aggregate-instructor-notes']`.

# sandpaper 0.4.1

MISC
----

* The All in One page and Keypoints page have been redesigned. These now both
  use the underlying internal function `build_agg_page()` (build aggregate
  page). This allows slow templating processes to be performed once and cached
  instead of repeated for each page. It provides a framework for future
  aggregate pages (such as figures, instructor notes, glossary, etc).
* A message is now printed when Keypoints and All-in-one pages are written to
  disk if `quiet = FALSE`.

# sandpaper 0.4.0

NEW FEATURES
------------

* An all-in-one page is now available for lesson websites at `/aio.html` and
  `instructor/aio.html`. 

MISC
----

* Provisioning of the global lesson element cache (metadata, AST, and global
  variables for varnish) is now all executed via `this_lesson()`, which is run
  during `validate_lesson()`. This simplifies the setup a bit, and provides the
  same method of cache invalidation (checking git outputs) for all of these
  elements


# sandpaper 0.3.6

MISC
----

* custom sandpaper and varnish engines will be properly linked to the footer
  of the lesson pages via this version and varnish 0.1.8.
* testthat tests have been updated.
* a diagram in the vingettes has been updated to reflect the parallel roles of
  sandpaper and pegboard to a lesson.

# sandpaper 0.3.5

BUG FIX
-------

* `keypoints.html` is now rendered as `key-points.html` to fix navigation error
  with varnish.

# sandpaper 0.3.4

CONTINUOUS INTEGRATION
----------------------

 * pr-receive.yaml has been updated to not report errors for workflow updates.
   See https://github.com/carpentries/sandpaper/issues/263 for details

# sandpaper 0.3.3

BUG FIXES
---------

 * Links from the index page to the setup or any episodes now correctly render
 * Links to the setup page now redirect to `index.html#setup` (@zkamvar, #262)
 * The setup page is now included in the instructor view after the schedule
 * The setup in the index page is now a separate section with the id "setup"
 * The schedule in the instructor index page is now in a separate section with 
   the id "schedule"

DEPENDENCIES
------------

 * The minimum version of {varnish} required is now 0.1.5

CONTINUOUS INTEGRATION
----------------------

 * A small bug in the update cache workflow that caused a silent error with no
   detremental effect was fixed (@zkamvar, #250)

# sandpaper 0.3.2

DEPENDENCIES
------------

 * The minimum version for {pegboard} should be at least 0.2.3 to accomodate
   div validation (@sstevens2, #259)
 * The minimuim version for {varnish} should be at least 1.5.0.

# sandpaper 0.3.1

BUG FIXES
---------

* Documents with footnotes without trailing newlines will now parse the external
  links correctly by adding a newline between the document and the links.

# sandpaper 0.3.0

NEW FEATURES
------------

* Common links for markdown lessons can be included via a file at the top of the
  lesson called `links.md`. If this file exists, it will be concatenated on each
  markdown file before it is rendered to HTML. Thanks to @sstevens2 for bringing
  this feature up (@zkamvar, #257)
* `create_lesson()` now includes `links.md` in main directory.
* A new help page called `?sandpaper.options` provides documentation on the
  global options used in a sandpaper lesson (subject to change).

# sandpaper 0.2.0

NEW FEATURES
------------

* `validate_lesson()` will perform checks on links and fenced divs in your
  lesson. This is now included in calls to `build_lesson()`, `ci_deploy()` and
  `serve()` (@zkamvar, #255)

DEPENDENCIES
------------

* the minimum pegboard version is now 0.2.0

BUG FIXES
---------

* internal function `this_lesson()` will now properly invalidate and reset if
  there is a change in commit (e.g. the lesson to build has switched).

# sandpaper 0.1.6

BUG FIX
-------

* `set_dropdown()` no longer fails with {cli} version 3.2.0

# sandpaper 0.1.5

INTERNAL
--------

* metadata is now processed more consistently across page types, which will
  first and foremost reduces some of the code complexity, and second, allows
  for more rapid development of future page types. In some instances, this will
  result in a marginal improvement of build times, but it will not likely be
  noticable.

# sandpaper 0.1.4

BUG FIX
-------

* `sandpaper::build_lesson()` no longer creates an infinite loop when called
  after `sandpaper::serve()` (@zkamvar, #247)

# sandpaper 0.1.3

MISC
----

 * Clarify license information to specify the copyright is held by The Carpentries

# sandpaper 0.1.2

BUG FIX
-------

 * invalid sitemaps have been fixed to have the correct namespace and include a
   slash in the site name.
 * a test requring pandoc 2.11 has been suppressed on systems without that
   version of pandoc.

# sandpaper 0.1.1

DEPENDENCIES
------------

* The {pegboard} package is now required to be 0.1.0 or greater due to a fix for
  generating the keypoints page (https://github.com/carpentries/pegboard/pull/76)

METADATA
--------

 * The metadata included in the lesson footer now correctly states the `@type`
   as `TrainingMaterial` (@zkamvar, #236)
 * A basic sitemap is now constructed for the lesson (@zkamvar, #243)

BUG FIX
-------

 * Empty pages will no longer throw errors in rendering and they will not be
   included in the output (@zkamvar, #237)

# sandpaper 0.1.0

BUG FIXES
---------

* the internal function `render_html()` now passes the `--preserve-tabs`
  parameter to prevent pandoc from removing educationally relevant information
  from the lessons.
* when rebuilding a lesson with `ci_deploy(..., rebuild = TRUE)`, detritus in
  the lesson site will be cleaned (@zkamvar, #91).

BREAKING CHANGES
----------------

* Add support for the updated frontend in {varnish}. This means that you will
  need varnish 0.1.0 installed in order to use this update. This change includes
  modifications to the lua filters along with the general handling of the HTML
  elements which means that older versions of varnish will cease to work.
* code blocks will no longer contain package links. While the links may have
  been handy for sighted users to explore documentation, these may represent
  objstructions for users who rely on screen-readers.

INSTRUCTOR VIEW
---------------

There are now two views of the lesson: instructor view and learner view. The
biggest difference is that instructor view gains the `instructor-note` sections
(if they exist).

* Static pages for each view. This means that you can toggle between the pages
  without needing javascript. 
* Removed timings on the learner view (to avoid discouraging our learners)
* Setup page replaces the schedule on the index page
* There are additional buttons included on the instructor view that do not yet
  work, but will work at some point!

The only downside at the moment is that building the lesson takes _a bit_ longer
due to the fact that we now have to render two pages for each change.

NAVIGATION
----------

A persistant sidebar with links for the main content of the lesson will be
present on all pages of the lesson. The navigation bar will prioritise items
used most frequently by the respective audiences:

* Learners: Key Points, Glossary, Learner Profiles, "Additional Information"
  (dropdown)
* Instructors: Key Points, Instructor Notes, Extract All Images, "More"
  (dropdown)

MISC
----

* The build database now gains a "date" column which will indicate the date
  the file was last rendered to markdown. This allows the "last updated on" to
  better reflect the state of the contents from the rendered files.
* The default configuration file now includes a `keywords:` item where you can
  place a comma-separated list of keywords to include in the site's metadata
* The configuration file now also includes an example of what provisioned 
  navigation looks like
* The default episode template now refers to the correct documentation links and
  provides examples of how to represent code blocks that are not evaluated.
* The setup page now contains a structured example setup page that shows how to
  provide dropdown menus for different operating systems (@zkamvar, #28).
* If the user does not have a github PAT and we can not detect the name of the
  repository from the git setup, then the source goes to an example.com link.

# sandpaper 0.0.0.9075

BUG FIX
-------

* Episodes with missing timing metadata will no longer fail if they also contain
  questions and objectives blocks. (@zkamvar, #222).

# sandpaper 0.0.0.9074

BUG FIX
-------

* Internal function `renv_cache_available()` continues to work with {renv}
  0.15.0.  This new version of {renv} changed the default value of a
  configuration setting for the system cache from a logical to NULL, which
  casued a logical operation to fail. (@zkamvar, #223)

# sandpaper 0.0.0.9073

DEPENDENCY UPDATE
-----------------

* {renv} is pinned to version 0.14.0 as version 0.13.2 would throw an error when
  checking for consent. 

# sandpaper 0.0.0.9072

NEW FUNCTION
------------

* `serve()` now allows you to work on your lesson and have it automatically 
  rebuild whenever you save your files to disk.

NEW DEPENDENCIES
----------------

* {servr} is now used in the `serve()` function.

# sandpaper 0.0.0.9071

NEW FEATURE
-----------

 * Lesson blocks are now treated the same as other blocks. This is a placeholder
   for us to better test the separation of the lesson veiw from the default 
   learner view.

# sandpaper 0.0.0.9070

BUG FIX
-------

 * Lessons that have readonly zlib compressed files (read: git objects) can now
   have their websites built. (@zkamvar, #214)

# sandpaper 0.0.0.9069

MISC
----

* `build_handout()` is now an officially exported function.
* The pkgdown documentation has been updated

# sandpaper 0.0.0.9068

CONTINUOUS INTEGRATION
----------------------

* Workflows have been updated to use `ubuntu-latest` instead of `macOS-11`.
  The macOS runners were often ~ 1 minute faster than the ubuntu runners, but
  the tradeoff was potential failures when packages were not available as
  binary versions and would need compilation with external C libraries (along
  with runs failing due to brew timeouts). This update coincides with an update
  for the github actions, which will now check and install the ubuntu
  dependencies before updating/installing packages. (@zkamvar, #184)

# sandpaper 0.0.0.9067

BUG FIX
-------

* A situation where git would fail if it could not remove everything was fixed
  (#206, @zkamvar)
* Addressed CLI failures due to glue version 1.5.0
  (https://github.com/r-lib/cli/issues/370#issuecomment-965496848)

# sandpaper 0.0.0.9066

API CHANGE
----------

* `set_config()` now takes a named vector/list instead of a pair of vectors.

# sandpaper 0.0.0.9065

NEW FEATURES
------------

* `set_config()` will set singular items in the configuration file (@zkamvar, #193)

# sandpaper 0.0.0.9064

BUG FIX
-------

* Package discovery now respects the lesson environment, which was unfixed from
  0.0.0.9063

# sandpaper 0.0.0.9063

BUG FIX
-------

* The package cache can now be built from external {renv} environments
  (@zkamvar, #197).


# sandpaper 0.0.0.9062

BUG FIX
-------

* New lessons that specify custom titles will have them reflected in the config
  file (@zkamvar, #195).

# sandpaper 0.0.0.9061

BUG FIX
-------

* lessons with colons in the title are now correctly processed (@zkamvar, #192)
* code injection in yaml is now protected against by setting `eval.expr = FALSE`
  in all yaml parsing calls.

# sandpaper 0.0.0.9060

BUG FIX
-------

* The title of the lesson will now appear in the index page.

MISC
----

* The translation script no longer lives in the lesson repo and has been moved
  (and modified) to https://data-lessons/lesson-transition/

# sandpaper 0.0.0.9059

CONTINUOUS INTEGRATION
----------------------

* The scheduler for `update-cache.yaml` has been fixed to run strictly on the
  first Tuesday of the month instead of the first seven days of the month AND on
  Tuesdays.

# sandpaper 0.0.0.9058

CONTINUOUS INTEGRATION
----------------------

* `update-cache.yaml` has been simplified to pull from the carpentries/actions
  repository and now updates packages that were not previously included in the
  lockfile (#185).

# sandpaper 0.0.0.9057

CONTINUOUS INTEGRATION
----------------------

* `update-cache.yaml` has been fixed from a regression introduced with
  4b8b14d088d03a8a9c6c90e974bb53c35691fb49 where the workflow would not run 
  because it did not check out the repository beforehand.

# sandpaper 0.0.0.9056

BUG FIX
-------

* `update_github_workflows()` now sets `clean = "*.yaml"` by default to align
  with the behavior of the GitHub workflow and to prevent stale workflows from
  being present in the repository. (#181, @zkamvar)

# sandpaper 0.0.0.9055

CONTINUOUS INTEGRATION
----------------------

* `sandpaper-main.yaml` and `pr-receive.yaml` have been simplified by using 
  composite actions hosted in `carpentries/actions/setup-sandpaper` and
  `carpentries/actions/setup-deps`.
* The caching mechanism for R packages and the package cache can now be
  reset by modifying a per-repository secret called `CACHE_VERSION`.

BUG FIX
-------

 * A bug introduced in 0.0.0.9054 where dependencies were not discovered was
   fixed.

# sandpaper 0.0.0.9054

MISC
----

* `manage_deps()` runs slightly faster now that it no longer runs
  `renv::hydrate()` if no new packages have been added in the lesson.

# sandpaper 0.0.0.9053

NEW FEATURES
------------

* setting `option(sandpaper.handout = TRUE)` will create a code handout for R
  lessons that will live in `/files/code-handout.R` on your site.

MISC
----

* An internal caching mechanism has been added for `pegboard::Lesson` objects
  that we use for extracting components for the syllabus and the handout. See
  `?lesson_storage` for details.

# sandpaper 0.0.0.9052

CONTINUOUS INTEGRATION
----------------------

* `pr-receive.yaml` has fixed spelling.
* `pr-receive.yaml` has changed to short-cut the invalid PR messages and no
  longer build the lesson if the PR is invalid. Instead, it will emit the same
  warning message without building artifacts.
* `pr-comment.yaml` will no longer fail when no artifacts exist (which would 
  cause extraneous emails for users).

DOCUMENTATION
-------------

* Documentation for test fixtures has been improved to include branch functions.

# sandpaper 0.0.0.9051

MISC
----

The template for the pull request message reverts back to two-dot diff notation
between branches, which is temporary until #169 can be addressed. Linebreaks
within paragraphs have been removed to avoid github formatting them as
linebreaks.

# sandpaper 0.0.0.9050

This update for {sandpaper} brings in dependency management for lessons with
generated content which will make collaboration between these lessons much 
easier and less invasive by establishing a package cache and lockfile via the 
{renv} R package.

DEPENDENCY MANAGEMENT
---------------------

### Introduction

We use the {renv} package for controlling dependency management in the lesson,
which is contained in a {renv} profile called "lesson-requirements". We have
implemented this as a profile instead of the default {renv} environment to give
the maintainers flexibility of whether or not they want to use the package cache.

### Consent for Using the Package Cache

 - `getOption('sandpaper.use_renv')` will be set when {sandpaper} loads to
   detect if the contributor has previously consented to use the {renv} package.
   If this is `TRUE`, the lesson will use a package cache, otherwise, the lesson
   will use the default library.
 - `use_package_cache()` will give consent to {sandpaper} to create and use a
   package cache via {renv}. Internally, this enforces that
   `options(sandpaper.use_renv = TRUE)`.
 - `no_package_cache()` does the opposite of `use_package_cache()` and revokes
   consent to use the package cache in a lesson temporarily. This can be useful
   in situtations where the cache is mis-behaving or you want to test the lesson
   using a newer set of packages. Internally, this enforces that
   `options(sandpaper.use_renv = FALSE)`.
 - `package_cache_trigger(TRUE)` allows you to trigger a full rebuild when the
   lockfile changes. This is set to `TRUE` by default on `ci_build_markdown()`

### Managing the Package Cache

 - `manage_deps()` is a new function that will manage dependencies for a lesson.
   This is called both in `create_lesson()` and `build_markdown()` to ensure
   that the correct dependencies for the lesson are installed. This explicitly
   calls `use_package_cache()` when it runs.
 - `update_cache()` will bring in updates for the lesson cache.
 - `pin_version()` will pin packages to a specific version, allowing authors to
   upgrade or downgrade packages at will.

NEW FEATURES
------------

 - `create_lesson()` now additionally will create a {renv} profile called
   "packages" in the lesson repository if `getOption('sandpaper.use_renv')` is 
   `TRUE`. This will make the lesson more portable.
 - index and README files can now be Rmd files (though it is recommended to use
   .renvignore for these files if they are to avoid {sandpaper} becoming part of
   the package cache).
 - internal function `ci_deploy()` will set `sandpaper.use_renv` option to 
   `TRUE`
 - `build_markdown()` and thus `build_lesson()` will now cache `config.yaml` and
   `renv.lock`. It will no longer step through the build process if no markdown
   files need to be rebuilt. This will cause any project built with previous
   versions of sandpaper to be fully rebuilt. 
 - `sandpaper_site()` (and thus, `build_lesson()`) now can take in a single file
   for rendering and render that specific file regardless if it is present in
   the cache without rendering other files. This further addresses #77. (n.b.
   this involved changes to `build_markdown()`, `build_site()`, and 
   `build_status()`).
 - `varnish_vars()` is a list that contains commonly used variables in the
   lesson that can not be contained in the config.yaml
 - `build_episode()` and `build_home()` now supply default variables to varnish.

CONTINOUS INTEGRATION
---------------------

 - unexported function `ci_deploy()` will now automatically check and set the
   git user and email.
 - `sandpaper-main.yaml` and `pr-receive.yaml` have been updated to include
   the {renv} cache, but they will skip these steps for markdown lessons.
 - `update-cache.yaml` is a new workflow that will update the package cache
   lockfile and create a pull request to trigger new builds if the lesson uses
   {renv}.
 - `update-workflows.yaml` now produces more informative instructions for
   creating a repository secret.

MISC
----

 - some of the {callr} functions have been made non-anonymous and moved to a
   separate file so they could be tested independently.

BUG FIX
-------

 - changes to `config.yaml` are now reflected on the lesson site without
   rebuilding (fixes #75)
 - knitr option `root.dir` has been set to the output directory to avoid
   generated content from entering the source.

# sandpaper 0.0.0.9049

This is a placeholder for the testing of 0.0.0.9050.

# sandpaper 0.0.0.9048

BUG FIX
-------

* pandoc lua filter no longer errors on raw div HTML elements with no class
  (@zkamvar, #166)

# sandpaper 0.0.0.9047

CONTINUOUS INTEGRATION
----------------------

 - The `update-workflows.yaml` workflow now checks if the `SANDPAPER_WORKFLOW`
   secret is valid. If not, it provides instructions for creating a new secret.

# sandpaper 0.0.0.9046

CONTINUOUS INTEGRATION
----------------------

 - Weekly run pull requests now default to "weekly run" for "who triggered this
   pull request"

# sandpaper 0.0.0.9045

CONTINUOUS INTEGRATION
----------------------

 - Weekly run has been added for the workflows action
 - Actions have been updated to reflect the zkamvar -> carpenteries repository
   transfer (@zkamvar, #156)

# sandpaper 0.0.0.9044

CONTIUOUS INTEGRATION
---------------------

 - The `update-workflow.yaml` parameters have been fixed to not use wildcards

MISC
----

 - `update_github_workflows()` gains a `clean` argument and now will print
   status reports at the end. 


# sandpaper 0.0.0.9043

CONTINUOUS INTEGRATION
----------------------

 - The `update-workflow.yaml` workflow has been updated to use the github action
   hosted on `zkamvar/actions` (soon to be transferred to The Carpentries account
 - The names of the actions displayed on GitHub have been updated to be more
   descriptive.
 - The script in `inst/scripts/update-workflows.sh` has been removed in favor of
   the github action.

# sandpaper 0.0.0.9042

CONTINUOUS INTEGRATION
----------------------

 - An experimental `update-workflow.yaml` workflow has been created which will
   create a pull request that will update the workflows. It is still _very_
   experimental and it requires a scoped with repo and scope, but,
   nevertheless, the concept is currently valid.

# sandpaper 0.0.0.9041

MISC
----

 - `fetch_github_workflows()` has been renamed to `update_github_workflows()`
 - github workflows are no longer downloaded from an external source; they
   now live in inst/workflows. This will reduce the internet connection 
   requirements for setting up a lesson and testing sandpaper.
 - `create_lesson()` now reports progress as it goes along
 - tests were updated to use the fixtures

# sandpaper 0.0.0.9040

CONTINUOUS INTEGRATION
----------------------

 - `ci_deploy()` gains the `reset` argument, which can be used to clear the 
   cache for a clean build of the lesson.
 - `ci_deploy()` now uses `ci_build_markdown()` and `ci_build_site()`, 
   internally

# sandpaper 0.0.0.9039

CONTINUOUS INTEGRATION
----------------------

 - `ci_session_info()` will report the session information, which will help 
   clean up the workflow files.

# sandpaper 0.0.0.9038

CONTINUOUS INTEGRATION
----------------------

 - Fix broken deploy process on continuous integration caused by attempting to
   fetch all branches in a shallow clone (@zkamvar, #142)

# sandpaper 0.0.0.9037

CONTINUOUS INTEGRATION
----------------------

 - Output of `ci_bundle_pr_artifacts()` no longer escapes HTML-like output in
   the diff summary. 
 - remove {xml2} from explicit dependencies

# sandpaper 0.0.0.9036

CONTINUOUS INTEGRATION
----------------------

 - Documentation for `git_worktree_setup()` has been added for future versions
   of the maintainer and future contributors.
 - `ci_bundle_pr_artifacts()` is a new internal function that will create
   artifacts for GitHub to upload upon receipt of a pull request. This will
   replace clunky shell code that lived inside a YAML configuration file.
   (@zkamvar, #139)
 - add {brio} to soft dependencies (for testing, but maybe could speed up???)

# sandpaper 0.0.0.9035

CONTINUOUS INTEGRATION
----------------------

 - Tests for git operations were added to be more robust (@zkamvar, #137)
 - new test fixtures for a local remote repository was added to aid the above
   git tests.

# sandpaper 0.0.0.9034

NEW FEATURES
------------

 - Authors can now cross-link between files within the lesson as they appear in
   the lesson instead of trying to guess how the link would appear on the
   website. For example, if you wanted to reference `learners/setup.md` in 
   `episodes/introduction.md`, you would write `[setup](../learners/setup.md)`
   and it will be automatically converted to the correct URL in the website
   (#43). This is still backwards compatible with the previous iteration of
   writing the flattened link (as it would appear on the website).

# sandpaper 0.0.0.9033

NEW FEATURES
------------

 - `get_drafts()` will report any markdown files that are not currently 
   published in the lesson.
 - Draft alert notifications are controlled by the `"sandpaper.show_draft"`
   option. To turn off these messages, use 
   `options(sandpaper.show_draft = FALSE)`
 - The `set_dropdown()` family of functions will now throw an error if an 
   author attempts to add a file that does not exist
 - An error will occurr if the files listed in `config.yaml` do not exist in the
   lesson with an informative message highlighting the files that are missing.

# sandpaper 0.0.0.9032

MISC
----

 - The internal `get_resource_list()` function has been modified to incorporate
   the features of `get_dropdown()`. This means that all `get_dropdown()`
   functions will only report the files in the dropdown menus that actually
   exist in the directory (#134).
 - A persistant test fixture is now included to speed up testing time (#132 via
   #134)

# sandpaper 0.0.0.9031

MISC
---

 - The {cli} package is now an official import of the package
 - The warning message issued from the internal `warn_schedule()` function has
   been changed exclusively use cli messages and can be suppressed with 
   `suppressMessages()`.
 - The internal `sandpaper_cli_theme()` is used to style CLI messages. 

# sandpaper 0.0.0.9030

MISC
----

 - A test that caused problems with a new version of {pegboard} was fixed

# sandpaper 0.0.0.9029

MISC
----

 - The internal database is updated to use relative instead of absolute paths. 
   This fixes #129

# sandpaper 0.0.0.9028

NEW IMPORTS
-----------

The {pingr} package is now being imported to check for online access, which will
marginally decrease data usage (@fmichonneau, #127).

# sandpaper 0.0.0.9027

MISC
----

* `create_schedule()` (internal function) no longer uses pegboard's extensions
  for fixing reference links. 

# sandpaper 0.0.0.9026

MISC
----

* callout blocks with headers greater than h3 are now rendered properly and no
  longer forced to h3
* tests now clean up after themselves and no longer change the working directory
  by default
* {varnish} version bumped to 0.0.0.9005
* tests that require pandoc will be skipped if pandoc is not available
* tests for the presences of multiple files will use setequal instead of equal
  to allow for alternate sorting orders. 

# sandpaper 0.0.0.9025

DEPENDENCY UPDATE
-----------------

 * required {pegboard} has been bumped to version 0.0.0.9014
 * {renv} and {sessioninfo} added to Suggested packages.

# sandpaper 0.0.0.9024

BUG FIX
-------

 * `create_lesson()` will now enforce "main" or the default branch (if 
   init.defaultBranch is set) as the default branch for the new lesson. It will
   also try to make the URL match the project name and user name (but the latter
   is limited to users who have GitHub PAT set up that {gh} recognises).

# sandpaper 0.0.0.9023

BUG FIX
-------

* `build_episode_md()` now sets the `knitr.pandoc.to` knit option to allow for
  the chunk option `fig.cap` to be rendered as a caption. This fixes #114.

NEW FEATURES
------------

* `set_dropdown()` is now generalized to set any item in the dropdown menu
  (though this will likely be wrapped into a better-named function for
  generalized editing).
* `system.file("transform.R", pacakge = "sandpaper")` points to a file that 
  will be used for transforming styles-repo era lessons to sandpaper lessons.
* read/write cycles were reduced in markdown generation because we are no longer
  interfering with the manipulation of the files at this stage (and haven't been
  for a while now).

# sandpaper 0.0.0.9022

BUG FIX
-------

* `build_markdown(rebuild = TRUE)` now actually rebuilds the lesson
* Changing an episode suffix will no longer result in a build error. This was
  due to `build_markdown()` trying to clean _after_ building the output instead
  of before. It's a situation of throwing the baby out with the bathwater. In
  any case, this fixes #102.

# sandpaper 0.0.0.9021

BUG FIX
-------

* the template will be initialized with ALL folders with placeholders inside
  of the `instructor/` and `profile/` menus. This fixes #103.

# sandpaper 0.0.0.9020

BUG FIX
-------

* the `set_*()` functions no longer mess up yaml lists in `config.yaml`. This
  fixes #53. 

# sandpaper 0.0.0.9019

* The required version of {pegboard} has been bumped to 0.0.0.9012, which gives
  better error messages and allows us to read in {sandpaper} lessons with the
  Lesson object. 

# sandpaper 0.0.0.9018

* The episode template has been rearranged slightly and given level 2 headers.

# sandpaper 0.0.0.9017

ENGINE UPDATE
-------------

* The version of pandoc will be explicitly checked to ensure that the version
  used is at least 2.11.

# sandpaper 0.0.0.9016

BUG FIX
-------

 * `create_episode()` with `make_prefix = FALSE` will no longer create episodes
   prefixed with `-` (see #93).

# sandpaper 0.0.0.9015

NEW FEATURES
------------

* `fetch_github_workflows()` will download and update the GitHub workflows from
  the Carpentries actions repository. 
* `update_varnish()` will download and update the {varnish} styling package to
  your local repository. 

# sandpaper 0.0.0.9014

BUG FIX
-------

* Episode order is retained in the HTML navigation (#85)
* index.md is recorded in the site/build/ directory, and thus in the md-pages
  branch on deployment.

ENGINE UPDATE
-------------

The caching mechanism is now similar to that of {blogdown} where a database of
source files and their checksum hashes is kept and only the updated files are
built. This provides two advantages, the first is that we no longer have to peek
at the top of the files to check if they need to be updated and the second is
that we can keep the files in the right order (see #85)

Importantly, the workflow itself should not be affected, but there will be
changes in what gets displayed on the github diff of the md-outputs branch.

# sandpaper 0.0.0.9013

NEW FEATURES
------------

* In RStudio, the **knit button works** :tada: (fix #77; @zkamvar, #82)
* `sandpaper_site()` is a site generator function that allows {rmarkdown} to
  use the {sandpaper} machinery to build the site from
  `rmarkdown::render_site()`
* `build_site()` gains a `slug` argument that tailors the previewed content.
* `create_lesson()` will now create a blank `index.md` with `site:
  sandpaper_site` as the only YAML item. 
* HTML accidentally rendered to the source directories are silently removed
  when the site is built. (fix #78, @zkamvar, #84)

# sandpaper 0.0.0.9012

NEW FEATURES
------------

* Inline and reference-based footnotes are now supported.

# sandpaper 0.0.0.9011

BUG FIX
-------

* Bare links and text emoji (e.g. :wink:) are now rendered (fix #67).
* Objectives and Questions headings will now no longer be rendered (fix #64).

# sandpaper 0.0.0.9010

BUG FIX
-------

* If `index.md` exists at the top level, it will be used instead of `README.md`
  for the lesson index page (fix #56). 

# sandpaper 0.0.0.9009

BUG FIX
-------

* The lua filter responsible for creating the Objectives summary block at the
  beginning of episodes now uses native pandoc divs instead of HTML block shims.
  This ensures that the content is not corrupted by pandoc's section divs 
  extension. This addresses issue #64
* All aside elements will be forced to have level 3 headers (this fixes an issue
  with pandocs --section-divs where it couldn't understand when an HTML block
  contained only the start of an aside tag and decided to end the section right
  after it.
* The Objectives and Questions blocks will no longer include their headers in 
  the initial summary block.
* A bug introduced in version 0.0.0.9008 was fixed. This bug improperly used 
  regex resulting in the accidental removal of cached rendered images. This
  fixes issue #49
* Rendered images now have the prefix of `{SOURCE}-rendered-` in the 
  `site/built/fig/` subdir. 


# sandpaper 0.0.0.9008

BUG FIX
-------

* files that were removed from the source are now also removed in the site/built
  directory. This fixes issue #47

# sandpaper 0.0.0.9007

* HTML will now be processed with pandoc lua filters that will do the following:
  - overview block will be constructed from the teaching and exercises metadata
    with the question and objectives blocks
  - instructor and callout divs will be converted to `<aside>` tags
  - divs without H2 level headers will have them automatically inserted
  - divs with incorrect level headers will have them converted to H2
  - only divs in our list of carpentries divs will be converted

* README updated to reflect API changes

# sandpaper 0.0.0.9006

Continuous integration functions added:

* `ci_deploy()` will build the markdown source and the site and commit them to
  separate branches, including information about their source. 
* `ci_build_markdown()` will build the markdown source files and commit them
  to a separate branch, including information about the source commit.
* `ci_build_site()` will build the site directly from the markdown branch,
  bypassing re-rendering the markdown files. 

Miscellaneous additions

* {dovetail} no longer in suggests
* new internal function `build_site()` compartmentalizes the conversion from 
  markdown to html 
* any files or folders named `.git` in the episodes directory will not be
  copied over to the website.


# sandpaper 0.0.0.9005

* sandpaper now requires and uses additional folders and files:
  - CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md
  - learners/Setup.md
  - instructors/
  - profiles/
  - LICENSE.md 
* `_schedule()` functions have been renamed to `_episodes()`.
* `clean_*()` functions are now renamed to `reset_*()`
* Generic `set/get/reset_dropdown()` functions have been created to facilitate
  modification/access of folders that are dropdown menus inside of the lesson
* questionable practices with directories mucking about. 
* `build_markdown()` will now generate artifacts in the `site/built/assets/`
  directory instead of `episodes/` directory to prevent generated artifacts from
  being included in git (See https://github.com/carpentries/sandpaper/issues/24)

# sandpaper 0.0.0.9004

* Internal `html_from_md()` renamed to `render_html()`
* Internal `build_episode()` renamed to `build_episode_html()` and exported,
  but documentation still internal
* Internal `build_single_episode()` renamed to `build_episode_md()` and exported,
  but documentation still internal


# sandpaper 0.0.0.9003

* A regression in `build_markdown()` due to being called in a separate process
  was fixed.
* Internal functions for setting {knitr} options were migrated to live inside
  `build_markdown()`

# sandpaper 0.0.0.9002

* Migrate template to use fenced divs instead of {dovetail}. 
* `build_lesson()` will now render HTML in episode titles. 
* {callr} is now imported to protect the processes building markdown and HTML
  files. 

# sandpaper 0.0.0.9001

* Add `override` argument to `build_lesson()`. This gets passed on to 
  `pkgdown::as_pkgdown()` for more control over where the site gets built.
* Update dependency of {pegboard} to 0.0.0.9006, which includes the $questions
  field to make parsing the ever shifting landscape a bit easier. 
* First tracking version with NEWS
