     Lessons with generated content (R Markdown lessons) have an extra file 
     called `renv/profiles/lesson-requirments/renv.lock` that records the
     package versions used to build the lesson. These functions provide ways for
     you to manage these packages and turn it on or off while previewing the
     lesson.
